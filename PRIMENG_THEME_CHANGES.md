# PrimeNG Theme Configuration Changes

## Summary of Changes

We successfully moved the PrimeNG theme initialization from service-based loading to application configuration for faster loading. Here's what was changed:

### 1. Created a new provider-based configuration
- **File:** `apps/app/config/primeng-theme.provider.ts`
- **Purpose:** Provides PrimeNG configuration with theme initialization using Angular's provider system
- **Benefits:** Loads during app initialization instead of after component initialization

### 2. Updated app.config.ts
- **Changes:** 
  - Import and use `providePrimeNGWithTheme()` instead of basic `providePrimeNG()`
  - Removed the app initializer that was calling the theme service
  - Theme now loads as part of the initial app configuration

### 3. Updated app.config.server.ts
- **Changes:** 
  - Added `providePrimeNGForServer()` to override client configuration during SSR
  - Ensures no theme-related errors during server-side rendering

### 4. Cleaned up theme service
- **Changes:**
  - Removed PrimeNG initialization method from `ThemeService`
  - Removed unused imports
  - Service now focuses only on light/dark theme management

### 5. Removed obsolete files
- Deleted `primeng-theme.service.ts` (no longer needed)
- Deleted `primeng-theme.config.ts` (replaced by provider approach)

## Performance Benefits

1. **Faster Initial Load:** Theme configuration happens during app bootstrap instead of after component initialization
2. **Better SSR Support:** Proper separation between client and server configurations
3. **Reduced Service Dependencies:** Theme initialization is no longer tied to service lifecycle
4. **Cleaner Architecture:** Configuration-based approach is more aligned with Angular's modern patterns

## Testing

The configuration files pass TypeScript compilation without errors. The build failure you may see is from an unrelated issue in the `frontend-components` library and does not affect the theme configuration changes.

To test the theme loading:
1. Start the development server: `npx nx serve app`
2. Open browser developer tools and check console for: "PrimeNG Aura theme initialized successfully"
3. The theme should load faster since it's part of the initial app configuration rather than a delayed service call.
