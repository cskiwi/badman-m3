# Project README

## Project Overview

This project is a Angular (With SSR) + Nestjs monorepo using Nx. It is a full-stack application that demonstrates how to structure and manage frontend and backend applications within a single Nx workspace.

## TODO

Feel free to contribute to this project by creating a pull request.

- [ ] Check on how to build for bun runtime
- [x] Pre rendering routes doesn't spin up the server, so the HTTP calls are not working (Made a build workaround npm script)

## Other variants of this project

- Just Angular: https://github.com/cskiwi/angular-nestjs-starter
- With TypeORM and Postgres: TODO

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of this Nx monorepo is organized as follows:

### Apps

- **apps/app**: This is the main Angular application with SSR enabled.
- **apps/api**: This directory is used for running the backend server during development.

### Libsf

- **libs/backend/_shared**: This directory contains the entry point for the backend services. It includes necessary configurations and files to initialize and run the backend application.
- **libs/frontend/root**: This directory contains the entry point for the frontend services. It includes necessary configurations and files to initialize and run the frontend application.

## Getting Started

s

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (Node 20 is recommended, 22 doens't seem to build the SSG)
- Nx CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Applications

To run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and the application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

### Building the Applications

#### Build Frontend

To build the Angular application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the Application:

```bash
node dist/apps/app/server/server.mjs
```

### Testing

#### Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests:

```bash
nx run-many -t test
```

#### Running End-to-End Tests

To run end-to-end tests:

```bash
nx e2e app-e2e
```

## For blogs and documentation sites
You can enable SSG then because there is no login or dynamic content, you can build the site and serve it statically.
To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Add prerender to `apps/app/project.json`
```json
"prerender": {
   "routesFile": "routes.txt"
},
```

2. switch the `build` script to with the one from `build:ssg` in `package.json`
3. done
