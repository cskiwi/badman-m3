## Technical Context

### **Three-Tier Orchestration Architecture**
```
Request → Intelligent Assessment → Smart Route → Dynamic Execution

├─ SIMPLE (single action)
│   → Direct to implementation-agent (no workflow)
│
├─ STANDARD FEATURE (known pattern) 
│   → workflow-agent creates: research → implementation → testing
│
└─ COMPLEX SYSTEM (unknown scope)
    → PM analysis → PM creates custom workflow → Dynamic execution
```
